# Loan-Default-Prediction-Model
Developed a machine learning model to predict loan defaults and segment customers using a dataset of 100,000 records. Conducted EDA and feature engineering, handling missing values and outliers. Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and PCA models, achieving the highest accuracy with Random Forest. Performed K-Means clustering to segment customers by loan characteristics. Utilized data visualizations (heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts) to communicate insights and identified key predictors of defaults through feature importance analysis.
